		<h4 style="color: blue;">Our girl Bluemchen</h4>

		<span class="" style="" >I am “Bluemchen from the Pacific Coast”. I was born 2011 here in Oregon with my sister Bea in the ‘B-litter’. The Germans use the alphabet to number their litters. Thus all siblings from the second litter have B-names.
		They did not call me Bluemchen because nobody here can pronounce that. Bluemchen is German for little flower. When I was a puppy the black mark on my shoulder looked like a flower.
		Sometimes when I sit and you pet me I can get so into it that that I fall over backwards. I must admit it is a little bit embarrassing but it shows how important people are to me. I can be pretty intense and I like to look deep into the eyes of everyone I meet.
		I take life a little more seriously than my sister Bea which is only natural for the alpha dog in the kennel. I love the water and I have a lot of energy to run and play. I enjoy being a mother and taking care of my puppies.
