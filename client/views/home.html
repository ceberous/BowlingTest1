		<p style="padding-left: 1%; padding-right: 1%;">The Landseer European Continental Type (E.C.T.) is a fantastic dog breed that has its origins in North America. We have the pleasure of introducing this wonderful breed here in the US. Our dogs come from strong, healthy, traceable European champion bloodlines. All our breeding dogs were evaluated and are certified by the German Landseer Club. Thus our puppies come with a certified pedigree from the German Landseer Club. Before our Landseers are approved for breeding, they have to undergo an in-depth x-ray check of their joints. This check is conducted through the German Kennel Club by an independent vet or through the OFA organization here in the US. Dogs with bad joints will not be certified for breeding. On top of that all our dogs have been checked for genetic issues by different vets and the DLC. Internationally certified judges have checked our breeding dogs for breed compliance. The veterinary institute of the Oregon State University oversees our breeding program and monitors the health of our dogs. &quot;We love all dogs, it doesn&#39;t matter what size, but the Landseer is the ideal dog for us. It is elegant, powerful, devoted, strong, intelligent, committed, versatile.... We have never in our lives done anything that resulted in so much sustainable joy for everybody involved. Breeding Landseers is it !&quot;<br />
