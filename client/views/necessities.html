			<h3 style="color: blue;">What a Landseer needs</h3>
			Before you decide to buy a Landseer you have to ask yourself some questions and you have to be honest to yourself answering them. Because having a dog is a long term commitment, we want to make sure that you are really prepared to enter into such a commitment.
			Landseers are big, intelligent, athletic and elegant. They are the happiest when they are doing something with people. They love to be challenged with different tasks like swimming & retrieving anything you throw for them in the water. They also like to play fetch on dry land. Doing obedience and agility exercises are also quite interesting and challenging for them. Sometimes they run next to our bicycles this helps keeping them fit and strong.
			<h3 style="color: blue;">The new pack ( coming home)</h3>
			When your puppy comes home remember he has just left his litter and is used to playing with his brothers and sisters. During this play time he made lots of experiences that pointed out where his position in that pack was. Your family is the new pack and you will be his pack leader (it is	better for the transition when the pup knows his place). It is important for his development for you to behave like leaders. You must show him what is to be expected of him. To do this successfully you have to be clear amongst yourselves what the Landseer puppy is allowed to do and more importantly what it is not allowed to do.
			It is very confusing for the dog if dad teaches the dog sleep in it's doggie bed and the daughter takes the friendly little puppy with her to her own bed. It is important to remember that this dog will be over 100 lbs within a year or so. Consider now if you want the dog to sleep in your bed when it is fully grown.
			It would be best to keep the puppy in your house for the first few months The Landseer bonds strongly to his family. From the first day he needs to know he is a part of you. Living in the house is also important because the puppy needs to be “potty” trained. They can learn this very quickly just keep them off the carpet and let them out in the yard frequently. After the bonding period is over you can slowly train them to stay by themselves during the daytime in the yard. In the yard they should have a place to get out of the rain (dog house or the front porch…).Thus it is clear that a Landseer is not suitable for apartment living or for a house without a garden. Their part of the yard should be directly connected to the front of the house and – if possible - and they should see the street where people and other dogs go by. They need that so there is something going on around them and they won't get lonely while you are out.
			<h3 style="color: blue;">Puppy play </h3>
			It is important to find a play group where your pup can go to learn social skills around others during the first months. Good behavior is very important for a dog this size.
			The dog has to learn that it has to behave with other dogs and that they	are no threat. If there is an obedience class offered in your area you should visit them and talk with them about puppy play and obedience classes.
