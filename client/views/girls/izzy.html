		<h4 style="color: blue;">Our girl Izzy</h4>

		<span class="" style="" >My name is 'Izzy du Domaine Bachenaâ€™s' and I was born in September, 2009 in Belgium in Europe. I came to Oregon just after New Year 2010. The family picked me up from my breeders house during the holidays. My breeder, especially her children had tears in their eyes when I left.
		I am told that I have become a very pretty girl and all the boys here think I am really very attractive. My life here is just fantastic going to the beaches and playing on the property. My favorite playmate is Charlie. Even though he is much older he tries to compete with me,- ridiculous ! My favorite pastime is chasing the ball. Sometimes Charlie gets annoyed with me because I am faster and always get to the ball first. When my boss plays with us I think he gives Charlie an unfair advantage. I guess it is ok for Charlie to win sometimes. I also love to swim and play in the water. Sometimes I chase the stick with Schroeder ( he is a brown Newf) in Beaver Creek . But I especially love the wild ocean. It takes peoples breath away when they see me jumping into the wildest waves. I also enjoy playing with and taking care of puppies. They are so cute and need to be licked all the time. I had to help with Gingers last litter because they needed someone to show them the ropes. Looking after the little cuties was hard work but very rewarding. You can see the video below. I am happy that I have my own puppies now.
