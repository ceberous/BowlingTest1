			History of the Continental Landseer
			The Landseer Continental Type (CT) is a European dog breed that comes from a type of giant dog discovered in the north-east of North America during colonial times.
			Because of their good swimming skills these dogs were utilized by fishermen to tow nets to the shore. They were also noted for their ability to help drowning people. Therefore these dogs were bought and sold mainly by European fishermen. It is believed that by in large the exportation of these dogs occurred during the late 1700s. However, paintings show us that these dogs must have already existed in England in the early 1700s.
			Because of their impressive appearance they were the subject of numerous books and paintings. The most famous painting of this large white and black dog is a portrait called "A Distinguished Member of Humane Society" done by the renowned English animal painter Sir Edwin Landseer in 1838. In fact the subject matter of many of Sir Landseer’s paintings focused on these dogs. The breed was eventually named in his honor. <a ui-sref="history2" style="color: blue;">(More>></a>
